Prometheus is an **open-source** monitoring and alerting tool widely used for cloud-based applications. To better understand its powerful features and limitations, let’s examine them in detail:

### 1. **Metric Collection**

The primary purpose of Prometheus is to **collect metrics** from systems and applications, store them, and make them available for analysis. Metrics are crucial for observing the performance and health of systems. For example, CPU usage, memory consumption, and request response times are common types of metrics.

- **Pull model:** Prometheus uses a **pull model** for collecting data, meaning it actively fetches data from systems at regular intervals. Each application to be monitored must expose its metrics through an HTTP endpoint (such as `/metrics`). This allows Prometheus to **retrieve the data at specified intervals**.
- **Exporters:** In many cases, Prometheus cannot directly collect metrics from certain systems. Instead, it uses helper software called **exporters**. For example, **Node Exporter** collects metrics from servers, while tools like **MySQL Exporter** collect metrics from databases. These exporters provide the data that Prometheus fetches.

### 2. **Time-Series Data Storage**

Prometheus stores the collected metrics in **time-series format**. A time series is a sequence of data points recorded at successive points in time, where each data point is associated with a **timestamp**.

- **What is time-series data?** A time series represents measurements taken at specific times from a particular source (e.g., CPU). Each metric entry consists of:
  - **Metric name** (e.g., `http_requests_total`)
  - **Timestamp** (e.g., 2024-10-10T10:00:00)
  - **Labels** (e.g., `method="GET"`, `status="200"`)
  - **Metric value** (e.g., 120)

Prometheus uses **labels** to provide context and distinguish between different metric instances. For example, when monitoring HTTP requests in a web application, labels such as **HTTP method**, **status code**, and **server name** can be used to provide detailed insights.

- **Local storage:** Prometheus stores its data on local disk. By default, data is retained for a **limited period** (usually 15 days). While this short-term storage is efficient for memory usage, it can be inadequate for long-term analysis.

### 3. **Alerting and Alarms**

Prometheus enables you to set up **automatic alerts** and **alarms** when certain conditions in your system are met, allowing you to take proactive action before issues escalate.

- **Integration with Alertmanager:** Prometheus works with **Alertmanager** to generate and manage alerts. Alertmanager triggers alerts when a specified **threshold** is exceeded, and these alerts can be sent to various channels (such as email, Slack, PagerDuty).
- **Defining rules:** Alerts are defined using **PromQL** queries and are triggered when certain metric thresholds are met. For example:

  ```yaml
  alert: HighCPUUsage
  expr: node_cpu_seconds_total > 80
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: "High CPU usage detected"
    description: "CPU usage has been above 80% for more than 5 minutes."
  ```

  In this example, if CPU usage exceeds 80% for more than 5 minutes, an alert is triggered.

### 4. **Query Language (PromQL)**

Prometheus uses a powerful query language called **PromQL** (Prometheus Query Language) to analyze and manipulate the collected data. This allows you to **filter**, **aggregate**, and **calculate** metrics.

- **PromQL features:**
  - **Filtering:** You can query metrics with specific labels over a given time range.
  - **Aggregations:** Perform operations like averaging, summing, or finding the maximum or minimum of metrics.
  - **Advanced analytics:** Apply mathematical functions to analyze time-series data trends, such as using the `rate()` function to see the rate of change.

An example query:

```promql
rate(http_requests_total[5m])
```

This query calculates the rate of HTTP requests per second over the last 5 minutes. **PromQL** provides deep insights into your metrics by enabling complex data analysis.

### Prometheus Limitations

Despite being a powerful monitoring tool, Prometheus has some limitations:

1. **Lack of centralized storage in distributed systems:**
   Prometheus collects and stores data locally on each server. However, in large, distributed systems with multiple Prometheus servers, this local storage approach becomes inadequate. **Prometheus on its own does not provide a centralized, scalable storage solution**, which can be a disadvantage for those needing centralized observability across a large infrastructure.
2. **Limited long-term data storage:**
   Prometheus is not optimized for long-term data retention. It focuses on short-term storage, and additional solutions are required for long-term analysis. Tools like **Thanos** are often used to overcome these limitations by extending Prometheus’ storage capabilities.

### Summary:

Prometheus offers high-performance monitoring and alerting capabilities, but it requires **additional solutions** like Thanos for **centralized monitoring** in distributed systems and **long-term data storage**. Thanos addresses these limitations, enabling Prometheus to be used effectively in large-scale environments with extended data retention needs.
