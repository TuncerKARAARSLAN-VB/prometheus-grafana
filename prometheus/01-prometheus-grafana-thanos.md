**Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Thanos** are tools designed to provide metric collection, monitoring, and observability for cloud-based or large-scale systems. Let's explain each of them and the role of Thanos in this context.

### 1. **Prometheus**

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting tool designed to collect, query, and visualize **time-series data** from systems. Its core functions include:

- **Metric collection:** Applications and systems produce metrics at regular intervals. Prometheus collects these metrics and stores them in a database.
- **Time-series data storage:** Prometheus stores data in a time-series format, meaning each data point is associated with a timestamp.
- **Alerting:** It can generate alerts based on pre-defined rules.
- **Query language (PromQL):** PromQL is used to query and analyze the collected metrics.

However, Prometheus has some limitations. One of the biggest is the lack of a **centralized and scalable storage solution** for distributed systems (i.e., environments where multiple Prometheus servers are deployed).

### 2. **Grafana**

Grafana is a powerful **dashboard and monitoring platform** used to visualize metrics collected from data sources like Prometheus. By connecting to Prometheus, Grafana pulls the data and allows users to view time-series data in various visual formats such as graphs and tables. It also supports setting up **alerting systems**.

Key features of Grafana:

- **Dashboard creation:** Allows you to organize and visualize your data in custom panels.
- **Data source integration:** Supports many data sources, with Prometheus being one of the primary ones.
- **Alert and notification management:** Enables you to set up and manage alerts directly through Grafana.

### 3. **Thanos**

Thanos is a solution that makes Prometheus **scalable**. It is designed to address the shortcomings of Prometheus in distributed systems, particularly around storage and multi-server management. It extends Prometheus’ capabilities for large-scale environments.

Key functionalities of Thanos:

- **Centralized data storage:** It collects and stores data from multiple Prometheus servers in a centralized location for long-term storage.
- **Global querying and federation:** Thanos allows you to run global queries across data from multiple Prometheus servers.
- **Data replication and durability:** It backs up and replicates data to protect against data loss.
- **Long-term storage:** Thanos integrates with object storage systems like Amazon S3, enabling long-term retention of Prometheus metrics.

### Thanos’ Role:

Thanos **solves Prometheus' scaling and long-term storage challenges**. For instance:

- In environments with multiple Prometheus servers, Thanos links them together and aggregates data, allowing for global queries and a centralized observability layer.
- While Prometheus stores data for a limited period (e.g., a few weeks), Thanos enables long-term storage, allowing access to metrics from months or even years ago.

### In Summary:

- **Prometheus:** Metric collection and short-term storage.
- **Grafana:** Visualization and monitoring of metrics.
- **Thanos:** Enables Prometheus to scale, provides long-term storage, and allows centralized querying.

These three tools are often used together in large, distributed systems to provide comprehensive **observability**.
